# Callbacks in C++

Callbacks are a fundamental mechanism for implementing event-driven programming in C++. They allow you to specify a function (or callable object) that will be invoked when a particular event occurs. In this document, we'll explore different approaches to callbacks in C++, including function pointers, lambdas, and `std::function`.

## What Are Callbacks?

A callback is essentially a function that is passed as an argument to another function. The receiving function stores the callback and calls it at the appropriate timeâ€”typically when an event occurs. This decouples the event producer from the event consumer, allowing for flexible and reusable code.

## Approaches to Implementing Callbacks

### 1. Function Pointers

Function pointers are the traditional C-style way to implement callbacks. They require specifying the exact function signature and do not offer much flexibility in terms of state or capturing context.

**Example:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// A simple callback function
void onEvent() {
    std::cout << "Event triggered using function pointer!" << std::endl;
}

class Event {
public:
    // Using a function pointer for the callback
    void (*callback)() = nullptr;

    void trigger() {
        if (callback) {
            callback();
        }
    }
};

int main() {
    Event event;
    event.callback = onEvent;
    event.trigger();
    return 0;
}
```

### 2. Lambdas

Lambdas provide a modern and flexible way to define callbacks. They can capture local variables, which allows the callback to maintain context without global variables.

**Example:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <functional>

class Event {
public:
    // Using std::function to store a lambda or any callable
    std::function<void()> callback;

    void trigger() {
        if (callback) {
            callback();
        }
    }
};

int main() {
    Event event;

    // A lambda callback that captures local context
    int value = 42;
    event.callback = [value]() {
        std::cout << "Event triggered with lambda! Captured value: " << value << std::endl;
    };

    event.trigger();
    return 0;
}
```

### 3. `std::function`

The `std::function` template is a versatile tool that can store any callable object (function pointers, lambdas, or objects with an overloaded `operator()`). This provides maximum flexibility, allowing you to change the callback type without modifying the interface.

**Example:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <functional>

class Event {
public:
    // std::function can hold any callable matching the signature void()
    std::function<void()> callback;

    void trigger() {
        if (callback) {
            callback();
        }
    }
};

void externalCallback() {
    std::cout << "Event triggered using std::function with external function!" << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    Event event;

    // Setting an external function as a callback
    event.callback = externalCallback;
    event.trigger();

    // Reassigning a lambda as the callback
    event.callback = []() {
        std::cout << "Event triggered using std::function with lambda!" << std::endl;
    };
    event.trigger();

    return 0;
}
```

## Benefits of Using Callbacks

- **Decoupling:**  
  Callbacks help separate the logic that triggers events from the logic that handles them. This leads to a more modular design.

- **Flexibility:**  
  The use of lambdas and `std::function` allows callbacks to carry context, making them highly adaptable to different scenarios.

- **Reusability:**  
  Once defined, callbacks can be reused across various parts of your application without rewriting the event-handling logic.

## When to Use Callbacks

Callbacks are particularly useful in scenarios where:
- You need asynchronous event handling.
- The producer of an event should not be tightly coupled to its consumer.
- You want to provide hooks for custom behavior that can be defined by the client code.

## Conclusion

Callbacks are an essential tool in event-driven programming, enabling you to design systems that are both flexible and modular. Whether you choose function pointers for simple cases or leverage `std::function` and lambdas for more complex scenarios, callbacks allow you to write cleaner, more decoupled code.

Feel free to experiment with these examples and adapt them to your specific needs. For more advanced topics, consider exploring how callbacks interact with multi-threading or how to handle errors within callback functions.
