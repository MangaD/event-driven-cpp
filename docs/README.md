# Documentation Overview

Welcome to the documentation for the **Event-Driven Programming in C++** case study project. This directory contains detailed explanations and guides covering the various event-handling mechanisms implemented throughout the project.

## Directory Structure

The documentation is organized as follows:

- **README.md**  
  This file provides an overview of the documentation structure.

- **observer.md**  
  A detailed explanation of the Observer pattern, its implementation in C++, and how it is used within the project.

- **callbacks.md**  
  An overview of function callbacks in C++, including examples using function pointers, lambdas, and `std::function`.

- **qt_signals.md**  
  Documentation on using the Qt framework’s signal-slot mechanism for event handling, including setup and usage examples.

- **io_and_sockets.md**  
  An explanation of event-driven I/O and socket programming using mechanisms such as `select()` on POSIX systems and Winsock’s `select()` with `_kbhit()` on Windows.

- **event_queue.md**  
  Details on implementing a message/event queue in C++ to process events sequentially.

- **event_driven_comparison.md**  
  A comparison of event-driven programming in C++, Java, Python, and JavaScript.

- **setup.md**  
  Step-by-step instructions on how to build and run the various examples in the project.

- **design.md**  
  A discussion of the design considerations and architectural decisions behind the project, along with best practices for event-driven programming in C++.

- **observer_vs_callbacks.md**  
  A detailed comparison of the Observer pattern and callbacks, outlining the pros, cons, and use cases for each approach.

- **what_is_event_driven_programming.md**  
  A comprehensive explanation of event-driven programming, its principles, benefits, challenges, and its relation to event-driven architecture.
